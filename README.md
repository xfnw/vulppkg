# vulppkgs

questionable nix modules not relevant or useful enough to be
put into nixpkgs.

also some opinionated changes to the defaults of existing
modules.

## there be dragons

i am fairly new to writing nix expressions, and there are
very few, if any, eyes on this. do not use stuff in here
without double checking that i have not done something
majorly stupid. you've been warned.

## formatting

modules are formatted with
[nixpkgs-fmt](https://github.com/nix-community/nixpkgs-fmt).
